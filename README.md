# Welcome to the Contacts Manager App README !!
Contacts Manager is an Android application that allows users to manage their contacts efficiently. Users can add new contacts, update existing ones, delete contacts, and sort them by name or date. The app leverages modern Android development technologies such as Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Jetpack Compose for UI, and Room database for local storage.


## Features
- <B>Add New Contact</B>: Users can add a new contact with an image, name, phone number, and email.
- <B>Update Contact</B>: Users can update all information of an existing contact.
- <B>Delete Contact</B>: Users can delete a contact.
- <B>Sort Contacts</B>: Contacts can be sorted by name and date.
- <B>Image Compression</B>: When a user uploads an image, it is compressed and converted to a byte array before being saved in the Room database.
- <B>Default Image</B>: If a user does not upload an image, the contact's name's first letter will be shown as the image.
- <B>Make Phone Calls</B>: Directly call a contact from the app.
